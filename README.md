## Hi there 🙋🏽‍♂️
## 🗣️Who am I? <br>
My name is Jaïr and I'm someone that is really passionate about web development and photography. 
I would like to create thoughtful designs that truly make a difference for businesses, whether it’s improving accessibility, enhancing user experience, or making things more intuitive and user-friendly.

## ❔What am I interested in?<br>
My goal is to create interactive websites and applications that feel alive using animation, emotion, and smooth feedback to create engaging experiences for users.

Currently, I'm learning React.js development, using Vite and Tailwind CSS as my foundation. With a strong UX/UI background, I focus on building experiences that not only look good but feel intuitive and responsive. I also experiment with new AI tools to speed up development, enhance creativity, and deliver smarter solutions.

- 🔭 I recently updated my personal portfolio with my latest projects take a look here: https://jairportfolio.vercel.app/
- 🤔I'm currently looking for a UX/UI-focused graduation internship, where I can apply my design skills to create new applications, websites, or features that help grow your business. While my main focus is UX/UI, I also have a growing knowledge of front-end development, giving me a strong understanding of how design and code work together.
